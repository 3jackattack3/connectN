def displayBoard

def check:
  cycles through the 2D list, until it finds an X or an O
  once it has, checks all spaces around it for another of that same type
  if it estabishes that there are two in a row, then calls another function checkSameDirection

def checkSameDirection:
  inputs a position in the 2D list, and 2 direction vectors, like in the blackbox lab
  checks the following few spaces in that direction at that starting point
  if there are N of the same type of chip (X or O), then one player wins!
  otherwise, returns, going back to the check function

def placePiece:
  user inputs a column to place piece in
  automatically places piece in lowest available space of that column, or informs user that column is full
